## Lessons Learned

I have learned how to use graphql in conjunction with apollo server. This application has tested my understanding og 
queries in regards to NOSQL and what makes graphql such a powerful tool.
I also was able to utilize the MERN framework and use every letter as in using MongoDb, Expressjs, Reactjs, and Nodejs.
